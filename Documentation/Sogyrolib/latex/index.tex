 \subsection*{Description Sogyrolib\+:}

Interface for the {\bfseries L3\+G4200D} with a twist. The Chip is connected to a seperate Arudino Nano. This Arduino Nano is used for getting the Axis. The {\bfseries Slave Arduino Nano} is connected via a {\bfseries S\+PI} bus to a {\bfseries Master Arduino}. The Slave Arduino Nano focusses on getting the {\bfseries D\+PS} (Degrees Per Second) values from the chip and keeping track of it\textquotesingle{}s {\bfseries own axis} in {\bfseries degrees}. The Master Arudino can acces these values by sending {\bfseries command bytes} to the Arduino Nano.

\subsubsection*{How to use it\+:}

{\bfseries Hwlib} is needed for this project, consult this page for more {\bfseries information}\+: \href{https://github.com/wovo/installers}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/wovo/installers}

The {\bfseries Slave Arduino Nano} needs to be connected to a {\bfseries Master Arduino Due} via {\bfseries S\+PI}. {\bfseries Flash} the slave code in the $\ast$/src/\+Slave\+\_\+\+Gyroscope$\ast$ Directory on to the Slave Arduino Nano. I have profided a {\bfseries test} in the \char`\"{}tests\char`\"{} directory.

{\bfseries Pin} connections between the {\bfseries Slave} and the {\bfseries Master}.

For the {\bfseries Slave} you need to connect these {\bfseries pins}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pin {\bfseries d4} is for the {\bfseries clock} pin.
\item Pin {\bfseries d5} is for the {\bfseries mosi} pin.
\item Pin {\bfseries d6} is for the {\bfseries miso} pin.
\item Pin {\bfseries d7} is for the {\bfseries cs} pin.
\end{DoxyItemize}

note\+: $\sim$$\sim$these pins can be changed by manually modifying the class$\sim$$\sim$

For the {\bfseries Master} you can choose whatever suits your mood.

Run this {\bfseries command} in the {\bfseries root} directory of this project for the Doxygen documentation\+: {\itshape Doxygen}

See the Doxygen documentation for more information on how to use this library.
