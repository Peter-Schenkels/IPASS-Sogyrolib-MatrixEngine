\subsection*{Description Matrix\+Engine\+:}

Interface and {\bfseries game making toolset} for the {\bfseries M\+H7219 Led Matrix chip} and other {\bfseries Hwlib Window peripherals}. This toolset includes a {\bfseries physics engine}, {\bfseries render engine}, {\bfseries collision detection}, {\bfseries camera movement} and more. Connect {\bfseries multiple M\+H7219 chips} via {\bfseries S\+PI} on the {\bfseries Arduino}. The toolset can also be used to run games inside the {\bfseries terminal}. (linux only)

\subsubsection*{How to use it\+:}

{\bfseries Hwlib} is needed for this project, consult this page for more {\bfseries information}\+: \href{https://github.com/wovo/installers}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/wovo/installers}

This library comes with a {\bfseries demo} file that is also connected to {\bfseries Sogyro lib}. But it can also be run without gyroscope (if you remove the gyroscope you wont be able to move the character).

See the Doxygen documentation for more information on how to use this library.

\subsubsection*{What you need\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Arduino Due (Master)
\item M\+H7219 Led Matrix Chip(s)
\end{DoxyItemize}

optional\+: Hwlib Window Peripherals such as an oled.
